        <p>Q. What personality traits does this Big Five test measure?</p>

        <p>
          A. The Big Five personality test measures the five personality factors
          that psychologists have determined are core to our personality makeup.
          The Five Factors of personality are:
        </p>

        <p>
          Openness - How open a person is to new ideas and experiences
          <br />
          Conscientiousness - How goal-directed, persistent, and organized a
          person is
          <br />
          Extraversion - How much a person is energized by the outside world
          <br />
          Agreeableness - How much a person puts others' interests and needs
          ahead of their own
          <br />
          Neuroticism - How sensitive a person is to stress and negative
          emotional triggers
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          The Big Five model of personality is widely considered to be the most
          scientifically robust way to describe personality differences. It is
          the basis of most modern personality research.

          Q. What is the difference between Big Five, Five Factor, and the OCEAN
          model of personality?
        </p>

        <p>
          A. Big Five, Five Factor, and OCEAN are all ways of describing the
          same theory of personality. Multiple psychological studies have
          arrived at the conclusion that the differences between people's
          personalities can be organized into five broad categories, called the
          Big Five or Five Factors. These are sometimes referred to as the five
          broad dimensions of personality.
